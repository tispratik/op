h1. TODO

h2. Next

* Bug/Issue: InheritedResources functional testing issue.
* Feature: Check for overridden templates in: RAILS_ROOT/lib/dry_scaffold/templates/

h2. Maybe

* Feature: Handle belongs_to, i.e. specify MODEL --belongs-to PARENT_MODEL, which generates proper routes, proper before-filters if inherited_resources-controller, adding belongs_to-association in model, and correct form_for arguments.
* Feature: Builder for podcast-feed, similar to RSS/Atom-builders. http://wiki.github.com/radiant/radiant/host-a-podcast
